## Setting up development environment

Before you get started you'll need to download a few things

- Ensure that you have node.js installed

- Download the Expo Go app from app store or google play store

Next clone the repository

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/cs-department-ecu/csci-4230-spring-2024/nba-or-sports-analytica-app/dunkdata.git
```

Run using gitbash
```
./setup.sh
```
This will create the envirmonment variables as well as install all of the necessary depenencies. All that left is to scan the QR code generated in the terminal after running setup.sh.

## Pulling the Latest Version

To ensure you are working with the most up-to-date version of the project, follow these steps to pull the latest changes from the repository:

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command:

```
cd dunkdata
```

3. Pull the latest changes from the remote repository using the following command:
```
git pull origin main
```
This command fetches the latest changes from the `main` branch of the remote repository (`origin`) and merges them into your local repository.

## Committing Working Changes

Once you've made changes to the project and you're ready to save those changes to the repository, follow these steps:

1. Check the status of your changes by running:
```
git status
```
This command displays which files have been modified, added, or deleted.

2. Add the files you want to commit to the staging area using:
```
git add <file1> <file2> ...
```
Alternatively, you can use `git add .` to add all modified files.

3. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message:

```
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message here"
```
Replace `"Your descriptive commit message here"` with a brief summary of the changes you made.

4. Push your changes to the remote repository:
```
git push origin main
```
This command sends your committed changes to the `main` branch of the remote repository (`origin`).

By following these steps, you can keep your local repository synchronized with the latest changes from the remote repository and contribute effectively to the project.
